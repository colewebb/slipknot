  <h4><a name="getting-started">Getting started</a></h4>
  <p class="sans-serif-main">
    This is the part where I get into the nitty-gritties of how this software works.
    If you want to know how to use this software, you're in the right place. If you're
    looking for how to install it, go <a href="install.html">here</a> (or click
    the install tab, at the top of the page).
  </p>
  <p class="sans-serif-main">
    Let's get started.
  </p>
  <p class="sans-serif-main">
    You've seen this image before, if you've been on the About page. If you haven't
    read the About page yet, I recommend you start there.
  </p>

    The Slipknot shell accepts the user's input on the command line. It then
    searches through a database, looking for keys that match the user's input.
    Finding a key, it will execute the other half of the key. Not finding a
    key, it will send the input, unchanged, to the operating system for execution.
  </p>
  <p class="sans-serif-main">
    It should be noted that while you can make more than one key link to the same command,
    but you can't make one key link to more than one command. Put another way:
    <code><br>x = exit<br>exit = exit<br>close = exit<br></code>
    <p class="sans-serif-main">works, but</p>
    <code>x = exit<br>x = rmdir<br></code>
    <p class="sans-serif-main">doesn't work.</p>
  </p>
  <h4><a name="nested-db">Making Multiple Databases</a></h4>
  <p class="sans-serif-main">
    Here's where things get fun, and here's the thing that sets this setup apart
    from other command line aliasing methods: you're not limited to one database.
  </p>
  <p class="sans-serif-main">
    Let me say it again for the peeople in the back: <b>you're not limited to one
      database</b>.
  </p>
  <p class="sans-serif-main">
    So, for the sake of explanation: you have a set of keys that you use together
    frequently. A common organizational scheme would be to group them together, using
    the same prefix with each, like this:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>fu-bar</code></li>
    <li><code>fu-snob</code></li>
    <li><code>fu-one</code></li>
    <li><code>fu-donuts</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="sans-serif-main">
    You get the idea.
  </p>
  <p class="sans-serif-main">
    But this is a pain. Slipknot changes this. You can add a database called <code>fu</code>,
    switch into it, and then use the keys <code>bar</code>, <code>snob</code>, <code>one</code>
     and <code>donuts</code> (which are defined in the context of the database <code>fu</code>). To do
    this, you would add a key to your default database that connects to a database
    file instead of a command. This database file must exist already, and it must
    have a file extension of <code>.db</code>. Using this key results in you being
    switched into the other database, which in turn opens up the keys in that database.
    It does turn off the keys from the first database, which means that the same key
    can mean the different things in different databases. This can get confusing very quickly.
    Being careful is advised.
  </p>
  <p class="sans-serif-main">
    Is this making any sense? No? TL;DR: you can nest databases. Add a key to one database,
    containing the location of the other database. Put in the name of the key the same as any other key.
    This will switch you into the new database.
  </p>
  <h4><a name="reserved-commands">Reserved commands</a></h4>
  <p class="sans-serif-main">
    There are a few commands that are reserved for the use of Slipknot. They are:
    <ul>
      <li>default</li>
      <li>help</li>
      <li>edit-db</li>
      <li>exit</li>
      <li>reset</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p class="sans-serif-main">
    These commands are meant to be used. In fact, they provide critical functionality.
    These commands are internal. Perhaps this will be be easier to explain if I put my
    previous list into a table.
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>command</th>
      <th>purpose</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>default</td>
      <td>returns the Slipknot session to the default database</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>help</td>
      <td>prints the current database to the screen, so that you can find that key you need</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>edit-db</td>
      <td>wizard for adding a key to the database</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>exit</td>
      <td>closes the session</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>reset</td>
      <td>resets the session, clearing the screen</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p class="sans-serif-main">
    I highly recommend adding all of these keys to all of your databases, in some form
    or another. At this point, there is no overarching configuration file that will
    make a set of keys work in all databases. You will have to add  each of the commands
    that you would like to use in a given database. I'm working on a fix.
