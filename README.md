# slipknot
Slipknot is a program, rendered in Python, for Linux, that gives new names to commands that you use a lot. It has at its core the dream of ultimate user configurability, where the computer confirms to what you want, not the other way around.

# install

To install this program, do the following things:


1. Make sure you have Python 2.7 installed, along with the standard libraries subprocess and os.
2. Clone this repo into some other wise empty directory.
3. Edit /etc/environment, make a new environment variable named SLIPKNOT_HOME, and set it equal to the path of the folder you just cloned this repo into. This must be precise.
4. Enjoy!


I did make a launcher that you can move around to wherever you want. It's in here just as slipknot, and is compiled from slipknot.cpp. This launcher is mobile, so you can put it in your executable path and use it as you would a normal executable.

Thanks!
