# Slipknot
Advanced Command Line Aliasing - Website Branch

## The Whole Thing
This is the website branch of my Slipknot project. That's pretty much it. It's pretty bare-bones right now. If you need information on Slipknot itself, I would recommend switching over to the master branch and reading the readme from there. If you want to help, I would highly value that. Make a fork, change stuff around, and then send me a pull request. I'll get right on it. Thank you!
